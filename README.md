# Smart Budget Desktop Application

## A personal budgeting application developed in Java

- This application will help individuals **set a budget** and keep track of **daily, weekly, and monthly expenses**. 
- It is intended for individuals interested in achieving their savings goals.
- I enjoy trying to save money, but the only time I was ever successful was when I was tracking my expenses daily.
  I find such apps to be very useful and so thought it would be fun to try to create one myself.
